🔐 Cybersecurity & Ethical Hacking
I am particularly interested in:

✔️ Penetration Testing (Red Team) – Offensive security strategies and exploitation techniques

✔️ CTF Challenges – Capture The Flag competitions to enhance problem-solving and hacking skills

✔️ Network Security – Exploring vulnerabilities and improving defense mechanisms

✔️ Reverse Engineering & Cryptography – Understanding exploits and encryption methods

📌 I frequently participate in CTFs, security challenges, and hands-on labs to sharpen my skills.
